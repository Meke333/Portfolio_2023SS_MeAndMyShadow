Me And My Shadow

-----------------------------
#IMPORTANT: 
This is only a showcase of my contributions (mainly code) and thereforethis repository has only a fraction of the full project. 
The full project is in a private repository, whose access can and are only given by me personally. This is done for 
avoiding legal issues due to having licensed Unity Asset Store packages open on Github.


#Basic Information:
2nd semester game project for summer semester 2023 in "Animation & Game" study course from the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences 
"Hochschule Darmstadt" (h_da).
This GitLab project is now uploaded later onto my personal GitHub repository to display it as part of a portfolio.


#Summary:
A 2.5D puzzle platformer, where you play as a shadow figure called "Mr. Shady", who can only interact and platform with shadows on the wall casted 
from the foreground objects in the room, and a kid named "Sam" who can move, rotate, pull forward and push backwards said objects in the 
foreground to manipulate the shadows on the wall for the shadow figure to progress further, in order to collect the crunchy cookies in each level. 
The control scheme is using the mouse for the kid and the keyboard for the shadow, which means that 2-player coop gameplay is also possible.


#How to view:
To view the assets drag them to the Unity Editor (Version: 2022.2.15f1).
To view code look in the Assets folder.
There is a prototype video in 4) and a walkthrough video in 3).


#How to play:
Download the latest build from the itch.io page from 1).


#Roles:
- Leonie Droege:    Vision Keeper, Texturing, Level Designer
- Bruno M端ller:     3D Asset Creator, Lighting, Sound Manager
- Lorenz M端ller:    Texturing, Animation, Quality Assurance


#My Contribution:
Roles in the project:
- Game Programmer
- Production Manager
- Game Designer
- Version Control Manager

My main work was being the Game Programmer, Production Manager and the Version Control Manager. But also small contributions in the 
Technical Art Department ("Mr. Shady" Animator) & Design
(Game Design: Game Loop, Early first Concepts; Menu/UX Layout & UI Animation, Trailer work 2))

Contibution Showreel Video in 5).


#Skills learned:
- Basic Project Management
- Git knowledge (using GitLab as repository, Fork as interface)
- Finishing a Game Project (Finalizing, Polishing)
- Basic Programming Patterns (Observer Pattern using C# Actions)
- Some Unity functionality (especially Raycasting, Rigidbodies, Layer-based Collision Detection)
- Building Tools for Designers (Level-Design Tools, Animation Curves)
- 2D Platform Game basics


#Challenges:
- First real game project to learn game programming
- Making a mouse controller select, drag and other actions with the mouse
- Handling Layers for foreground and shadow objects
- Game Structures
- Making Design-Tools in form of Prefabs (for automatic shadow generation or borders) for the designers
- Misplacing the .gitignore file in the wrong spot of the folders, resulting that immense sizes 
of files (like 'Library') are pushed every time (except deselecting them manually)

More details to challenges are listed in the "IndividualProjectDocumentation.pdf"
